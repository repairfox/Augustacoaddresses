# Augustacoaddresses
Augusta county, Virginia, Address and Building import

Virginia address Points source: https://hub.arcgis.com/datasets/VGIN::virginia-address-points/about

Split this file by LOCALITY Field (county). Then further split by ZIP_5 (post code).

All addresses in Augusta county are split by zip and stored in # Augusta_CO_SHP_by_postcode

As I extract data from these shapefiles to CSV and properly format them for import to OSM, they will be added to # (../CSV_ready_for_OSM).
