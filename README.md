Augusta county, Virginia, Address and Building import

My [Wiki page](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Augusta_county,_Virginia,_Address_and_Building_import) on Open Street Map

Virginia address Points source: https://hub.arcgis.com/datasets/VGIN::virginia-address-points/about

Split this file by LOCALITY Field (county). Then further split by ZIP_5 (post code).

All addresses in Augusta county are split by zip and stored in [Augusta_Co_SHP_by_postcode](/Augusta_Co_SHP_by_postcode).

As I extract data from these shapefiles to CSV and properly format them for import to OSM, they will be added to [CSV_ready_for_OSM](/CSV_ready_for_OSM).
